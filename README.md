# Online Store Project

## Overview
The Online Store project is a web application built with ReactJS and Redux, designed to serve as a learning tool for understanding state management and data flow in modern web development. The project utilizes a fake API to simulate product data and interactions typically found in an e-commerce platform.

## Features
- Display a list of products fetched from a fake API.
- Filter products by category, price range, or other attributes.
- Add products to a shopping cart.
- Update the quantity of products in the shopping cart.
- Remove products from the shopping cart.
- Calculate the total price of items in the shopping cart.

## Technologies Used
- ReactJS
- Redux
- Fake API (such as JSONPlaceholder or JSON Server)
- HTML5
- CSS3
